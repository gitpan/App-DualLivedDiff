NAME
    App::DualLivedDiff - Diff between the perl core and dual-lived modules'
    CPAN distributions

SYNOPSIS
    Example: Filter::Simple.

    Given a simple YAML file .dualLivedDiffConfig in the current working
    directory or the Filter::Simple CPAN distribution:

      ---
      exclude-regexes:
        - ^(?:\./)?MANIFEST$
        - ^(?:\./)?META.yml$
      files:
        lib/Filter/Simple.pm: lib/Filter/Simple.pm
        Changes: lib/Filter/Simple/Changes
      dirs-flat:
        t/: lib/Filter/Simple/t/
      dirs-recursive:
        t/lib/Filter/Simple/: t/lib/Filter/Simple/

    By running the following command, you can get the diff between your
    blead perl checkout and the CPAN distribution:

      dualLivedDiff --dual http://search.cpan.org/CPAN/authors/id/S/SM/SMUELLER/Filter-Simple-0.84.tar.gz --blead $HOME/perl-ssh

    Or this if you have CPAN.pm configured:

      dualLivedDiff --dual SMUELLER/Filter-Simple-0.84.tar.gz --blead $HOME/perl-ssh

    Or this if you want to search for a given module name:

      dualLivedDiff --dual Filter::Simple --blead $HOME/perl-ssh

    You can use the "base-path-in-blead" option in the YAML config file to
    set a base path within the blead-perl checkout. Example of the
    configuration for the Attribute::Handlers dual-lived module/distribution
    which lives entirely within ext/Attribute-Handlers:

      ---
      base-path-in-blead: ext/Attribute-Handlers
      files:
        Changes: Changes
        README: README
      dirs-recursive:
        lib/: lib/
        t/: t/
        demo/: demo/

    Run the "dualLivedDiff" program to get an overview of the command line
    options.

DESCRIPTION
    Very early version of a tool to automatically generate diffs/patches
    between CPAN distributions of dual lived Perl modules and the perl core.
    The code isn't beautiful. It's a hack.
