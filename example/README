The .dualLivedDiffConfig file in this directory contains the file
mapping from the Filter::Simple CPAN distribution to bleadperl as of
2009-03-07. You can test the program from the main distribution
directory with the following command: (provided you have a CPAN.pm
installation with a working setup)

perl -Ilib script/dualLivedDiff -c example/.dualLivedDiffConfig -d Filter::Simple -b path/to/your/bleadperl/checkout

You can add the option --output filter-simple.diff to write the diff
to a file instead of STDOUT (where the CPAN.pm blurb goes as well).

One option that's not shown by this example is the "base-path-in-blead"
option. By setting it, the specified path is prepended to all paths in
the blead perl checkout. Example (in YAML) that could be used to
simplify the diff configuration for the Attribute::Handlers module:

base-path-in-blead: ext/Attribute-Handlers
